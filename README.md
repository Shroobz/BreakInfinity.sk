breakinfinity.sk is a big number library for people creating incremental games
the limit is 1e9.227QI or 1e9.227e18

breakinfinity.sk contains every function needed for the library,
-breakinfinitycommands.sk needs to be enabled manually (only do this on private servers) 
and contains commands that return their value using the functions from breakinfinity.sk,

An example game will be added soon

!! I'm rewriting the entire system because skript doesn't allow accurate numbers due to it being in a string and accuracy being equal to skript accuract (default: 2)
